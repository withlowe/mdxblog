# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using **markdown** and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write your content in markdown
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are syntax highlighted
- **Frontmatter**: Add metadata to your posts
- **Static Generation**: All pages are statically generated at build time

## Code Example

\`\`\`javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('World'));
\`\`\`

## What's Next?

In the next post, we'll explore how to add more features to our markdown blog, such as:

1. Comments
2. Categories
3. Search functionality
4. RSS feed

Stay tuned!
